    "> Sami and Joel decided to apply themselves fulltime and started their first civictech startup Ontodia - becoming the first [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) professional services partner in the Americas in 2013 – deploying data portals in Jersey City, Newark, Allegheny County, PA; Boston, San Antonio, NYC Department of Education, and UNDP among others; launching CivicDashboards at Code for America 2015, before being acquired by [OpenGov](https://opengov.com/) in 2016.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> However, they found that OpenGov's SaaS business model constricting - as it disincentivized \"building with, not for\" their public sector customers, so they left OpenGov and started [datHere](https://dathere.com/) in 2019.\n",
    ">\n",
