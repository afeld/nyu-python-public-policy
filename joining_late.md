# Joining late

## Wait list

{% if school_slug == "columbia" %}
There's a wait list for Section 1, space available in Section 2.
{% endif %}

- There's a lot of churn in enrollment, so be patient.
- To be fair to everyone, it's first come first served.
- [How the wait list works]({{wait_list}})

### While you're waiting

- Attend class.
- Look through the [important links](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/{{school_slug}}/#important-links), including past lectures.
   - You won't be able to access [{{lms_name}}]({{lms_url}}) or the [Discussions]({{discussions_url}}).
- [Complete the Assignment(s) in {{coding_env_name}} as normal](assignments.md), waiting until you are registered to [submit](assignments.md#submission) them.

## Once you join

If you're coming off the wait list or registering for the course after the first lecture:

{% if school_slug == "columbia" %}
- Within 24 hours after you're registered via SSOL, you should be automatically added to CourseWorks.
   - If you don't have access after that, [email the instructor](syllabus.md#instructor-information).
{% endif %}
- Watch the [recording(s) of past lectures](syllabus.md#class-recordings) if you weren't present for them.
- Make sure to read through the pinned threads that appear at the top of the list of [Discussions]({{discussions_url}}), in case there's anything you missed.
- [Submit](assignments.md#submission) all [past assignments](syllabus.md#schedule).
- We will mark [Participation](syllabus.md#participation) for weeks prior to when a student is registered as Excused.
   - [Email the {{assistant_name}}](syllabus.md#instructor-information) if there's a mistake.

## Extensions

- We will grant extensions up to the following, whichever comes first:
   - Nine days after the [original due date](syllabus.md#schedule)
   - One week after you were enrolled in the course
- If we accidentally mark you as late, let the {{assistant_name}} know and we'll get it corrected.
- [The late submission deadline](syllabus.md#late-submission-deadline) will not be extended.
   - In other words: If you joined the class more than a week after the class starts, you can't turn in Homework 0 late.

This is a short class, and these rules are in place to:

- Ensure late-joiners get caught up quickly
- Allow solutions for homeworks to be shared sooner than later (so that students can learn from them)
