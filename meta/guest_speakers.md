# Guest speakers

Dear potential guest speaker-

[This seven-week course](../syllabus.md) teaches students data analysis through code. Most of it is very hands-on / in the weeds, so [The Bigger Picture](../syllabus.md#schedule) class is meant to help connect it all to the broader technology/policy/data/civic context. That's where _you_ come in!

Interested in giving a talk? Looking for 30-45 minutes, including Q&A. Pretty open in terms of topic. You could:

- Talk about your career trajectory
- Do a deep dive on a data-related project, inside or outside work
- Anything else you think these students might be interested in

Doesn't need to be about Python, doesn't even need to be technical. Happy to brainstorm with you if that would be helpful. Using a pre-existing talk is totally fine, too. More info about the class, if helpful:

- [Learning objectives](../syllabus.md#learning-objectives)
- [Topics we cover](../syllabus.md#schedule)

Thanks!
-Aidan
