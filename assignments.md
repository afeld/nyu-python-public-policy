# General assignment information

- To open an Assignment in {{coding_env_name}}, click the launch button (üöÄ) at the top of the Assignment page of this site.
   - You can also do this for lecture notebooks.

## Tips

{% if id == 'nyu' %}- **All lecture slides and homework templates can be found under [`class_materials/`](https://padmgp-4506001-fall.rcnyu.org/user-redirect/notebooks/class_materials/).** The contents of this directory will be automatically updated from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/afeld/python-public-policy/tree/{{school_slug}}), but should keep any changes you make.{% endif %}

- **Read the instructions carefully.** Like word problems from math class, they are very specific in what they are asking for.
- **Spot check your results.** If you are transforming data from a previous Step, compare the results, do a handful of the calculations manually, etc. to ensure that the results are correct.
- **[Don't repeat yourself (DRY).](https://dzone.com/articles/is-your-code-dry-or-wet)** If you find yourself copying and pasting code within a notebook, there's probably a better way to do it.
- **Avoid [hard-coding](https://www.quora.com/What-does-hard-coded-something-mean-in-computer-programming-context) values.** Don't rely on things like row numbers or column order being stable, in case the dataset were to be updated.

### Storing data

To keep your data between sessions, you'll probably want to store it in Google Drive.

1. Upload the file(s) somewhere in Drive.
1. In the Colab sidebar, click the `Files` icon.
1. Click the `Mount Drive` icon.
1. Navigate to the file.
1. Next to the filename, click the three dots.
1. Click `Copy path`
1. Use this path with `read_csv()`

{% endif -%}

## Submission

1. Ensure all the outputs are visible and the notebook is cleaned up.
   - This is a good time to run the notebook end-to-end with `Restart and run all`{% if id == 'nyu' %} (‚è©){% endif %}.
   - See [general scoring criteria](syllabus.html#assignment-scoring).
1. Leave your name off the notebook filename and the notebook itself, as assignments are graded anonymously.
{% if id == 'columbia' -%}
1. [Share your notebook](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#notebook-storage) with [the instructor and Reader](syllabus.html#instructor-information) with at least `Commenter` permissions.
   - To avoid needing to do this for each assignment, you can share the `Colab Notebooks` folder in Google Drive, which will apply to all notebooks you create.
1. Drop the link to the Colab notebook in the {{lms_name}} Assignment.
{% else -%}
1. Export the notebook as a PDF. From the Jupyter interface, go to:
   1. `File`
   1. `Download as`
   1. `PDF via LaTeX (PDF)`
1. Glance through the PDF to ensure everything is showing up as you intend.
   - What you see is what the instructors will see.
1. Upload the PDF to the {{lms_name}} Assignment.
{% endif %}

After the resubmission deadline passes for each Assignment, the solutions will be posted{% if id == 'nyu' %} in [`shared/solutions/`](https://padmgp-4506001-fall.rcnyu.org/user-redirect/tree/shared/solutions/){% endif %}.

Note: In-class exercises will not be graded.

## Common issues

{% if id == 'columbia' -%}
- **Mounting Google Drive is slow or fails:** See [the Google Colab help page](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#drive-timeout).
{% else -%}
- **PDF export:**

  - **Plotly charts/maps not appearing:** Include the [boilerplate](https://whynameitthat.blogspot.com/2013/10/boiler-plate.html) codeL

    ```python
    import plotly.io as pio
    pio.renderers.default = "notebook_connected+pdf"
    ```

  - **500 error:** You may be outputting too much data. Try reducing your output (in the Jupyter sense) to smaller subsets.

- **`Disk is full` / `No space left on device`:** Your workspace in {{coding_env_name}} has a limit of 1GB (a.k.a 1,000 MB or 1,000,000 KB) across all your files. Jupyter shows the `File size` of each in the file browser. Try deleting some larger files that you don't need anymore.
  - If you do fill it up, your server may not be able to start again (`spawn failed`). You'll need to reach out to the instructor.
{% endif -%}
- **When using `choropleth_mapbox()`, nothing appears on the map:** Make sure:
  - Your `locations` corresponds to the DataFrame column name and `featureidkey` is set to `properties.<property name>` matching the GeoJSON
  - The column and the GeoJSON properties have values that match

### Kernel/memory issues

{% if id == 'nyu' %}- Make sure `Python [conda env:python-public-policy]` is selected as the kernel.
  - Shows in the top right of the notebook interface
  - Change from `Kernel` menu ‚Üí `Change kernel` ‚Üí `Python [conda env:python-public-policy]`{% endif %}
- If your kernel is repeatedly crashing, you're probably running out of memory.
  - Make sure you aren't loading data sets you don't need.
  {% if id == 'nyu' %}- Close kernels you aren't using from the [Running](https://padmgp-4506001-fall.rcnyu.org/user-redirect/tree#running) page.{% endif %}
