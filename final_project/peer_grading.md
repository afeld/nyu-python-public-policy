# [Final Project](../final_project.md) peer grading

Your Final Project will be reviewed and graded by three of your peers, and you will grade three others'. These will be anonymous. [Scoring details.](../syllabus.md#final-project)

If you disagree with the grade, you can appeal by [emailing the instructor and grader](../syllabus.md#instructor-information). This comes with a risk: this new grade will be the one that's used, even if it's lower.

## How to review

1. Open [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/297088).
1. Go to [`Content`](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/297088), then `Final Project`. You should see an embedded TurnItIn/PeerMark dashboard.
1. Follow [these instructions](https://help.turnitin.com/feedback-studio/d2l/LTI13/student/peermark/writing-a-peer-review.htm).
   - Some students have reported issues when using Safari. If you're unable to access, try a different browser.
1. Check against [the analysis requirements](../final_project.md#analysis-requirements), factoring in the applicable [general assignment scoring](../syllabus.md#assignment-scoring).
1. Explain what points are being deducted for what.
1. State the final score in the comment area.

## Notes for reviewers

- Your feedback should include what they did well, as well as what they could do more clearly/simply/etc.
- The feedback should be constructive; don't be a jerk.
- Points should only be deducted based on the [requirements](../final_project.md#analysis-requirements). A "this could be done better/differently" comment doesn't _necessarily_ need to have a corresponding point deduction.
- You are _not_ expected to run any of their code. The notebook should be graded as-is.
- Reviews are expected to be in-depth, and thus take 15+ minutes each.
- As long as the feedback is thoughtful, you'll receive full points.
