## Description

This seven-week course exposes the students to the application and use of Python for data analytics in public policy setting. The course teaches introductory technical programming skills that allow students to learn Python and apply code on pertinent public policy data. The majority of the class content will utilize the [New York City 311 Service Requests](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) dataset. It's a rich dataset that can be explored from many angles relevant to real-world public policy and program management responsibilities.

Class will be split between:

- Lecture
- Demonstration
- Hands-on time to:
  - Play with the code from lectures
  - Start on the homework
  - Ask questions

## Homework

Homework assignments will consist of two different formats:

1. **Online tutorials:** In advance of classes, online tutorials will be assigned as homework. These online tutorials will introduce students to critical Python concepts. The following lecture will then focus on applying those concepts to real public policy data questions.
1. **Data exploration, analysis, and visualization:** Students will complete Python coding exercises that apply new concepts they have learned in lecture. Coding assignments will build off of concepts covered in previous assignments.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn how to:

- Use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
- Have an understanding of Python fundamentals
  - Common data types
  - Functions
  - Reading technical documentation
  - Troubleshooting
- Know how to use several Python packages for different kinds of data analysis, manipulation, and visualization

If the submission showed effort, feedback will be given.

For submissions that showed effort and were on time, the assignment can be resubmitted to improve the score. This will be due before the next class.

Requests for extensions will only be considered if made before the deadline.

### Participation

Participation means:

- Asking a question
- Answering a question
- Posting a useful/interesting resource

in either:

- Office hours
- [The Discussions in CourseWorks](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/171519/discussion_topics)
  - When starting a new Discussion, please use a descriptive Topic Title to make them easier to navigate

The following don't count towards the Between-Class Participation score:

- In-class participation, due to:
  - The difficuly of tracking participation live
  - Some students being more shy
- Homework revisions
- Communications about grades or other administrivia

A student's overall Between-Class Participation score is calculated based on some form of participation every week.

### Letter Grades

Letter grades for the entire course will be assigned as follows:

| Letter Grade | Points     | Description | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A            | 4.0 points | Excellent   | Exceptional work for a graduate student. Work at this level is unusually thorough, well-reasoned, creative, methodologically sophisticated, and well written. Work is of exceptional, professional quality.                                                                                                                                                                |
| A-           | 3.7 points | Very good   | Very strong work for a graduate student. Work at this level shows signs of creativity, is thorough and well-reasoned, indicates strong understanding of appropriate methodological or analytical approaches, and meets professional standards.                                                                                                                             |
| B+           | 3.3 points | Good        | Sound work for a graduate student; well-reasoned and thorough, methodologically sound. This is the graduate student grade that indicates the student has fully accomplished the basic objectives of the course.                                                                                                                                                            |
| B            | 3.0 points | Adequate    | Competent work for a graduate student even though some weaknesses are evident. Demonstrates competency in the key course objectives but shows some indication that understanding of some important issues is less than complete. Methodological or analytical approaches used are adequate but student has not been thorough or has shown other weaknesses or limitations. |
| B-           | 2.7 points | Borderline  | Weak work for a graduate student; meets the minimal expectations for a graduate student in the course. Understanding of salient issues is somewhat incomplete. Methodological or analytical work performed in the course is minimally adequate. Overall performance, if consistent in graduate courses, would not suffice to sustain graduate status in "good standing."   |
| C+           | 2.3 points | Deficient   | Inadequate work for a graduate student; does not meet the minimal expectations for a graduate student in the course. Work is inadequately developed or flawed by numerous errors and misunderstanding of important issues. Methodological or analytical work performed is weak and fails to demonstrate knowledge or technical competence expected of graduate students.   |
| C            | 2.0 points | "           | "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| C-           | 1.7 points | "           | "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| F            | 0.0 points | Fail        | Work fails to meet even minimal expectations for course credit for a graduate student. Performance has been consistently weak in methodology and understanding, with serious limits in many areas. Weaknesses or limits are pervasive.                                                                                                                                     |

## Class Policies

A student may work with other students. However, assignment solutions should not be identical to / copied-and-pasted from one another, and each student should submit theirs separately. In addition, students need to indicate who they worked with with each submission.

Similarly, it is common practice to use code snippets found on the internet; these sources must be cited.

Students are more than welcome to share approaches and code snippets in the Discussions, so long as they aren't giving the full solution away.

All submissions must be made from a Jupyter notebook file, following [these instructions](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/README.html#turning-in-assignments).

Attendance is mandatory but most importantly, important. Learning programming requires commitment from the part of the student and the skills are built out of practice.
